1. CI/CD add github actions, config written in .yaml
2. use environment variables while deploying with SAM and Amplify in .yaml files.
3. Instead directly committing to master branch there should be release branches created and squash&merge policy should be applied.
4. Dynamo db is not good for getting sorted data, data where table union or merge is required.
5. Better error handling in lambdas. More cases for error codes (400,401,403 etc)
6. Error boundary in Frontend(react);
7. More detailed .yaml descriptions regarding API gateway
8. Manual creation of AIM roles that can be assigned to lambdas so actions can be limited to the most necessary ones.
